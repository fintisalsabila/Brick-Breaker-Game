About Brick Breaker Game
The Brick Breaker Game is a web application coded purely in JavaScript. The game uses a Bootstrap template to create the design structure. The player controls the game using keyboard bindings (Left Arrow Key to move left, Right Arrow Key to move right). The game is simple: the player must catch the ball correctly to make it bounce upward and break the bricks. If you fail to catch the ball, the game will be over. Try to destroy all the bricks above to finish the game.
